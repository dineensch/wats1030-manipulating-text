# Post Project Thoughts:

## *Emacs*

### Likes
* No need to switch between 'Command' and 'insert' while editing (like Vi)
* The ability to add windows, vertically or horizontally, and switch between them easily
* The search & replace commands
* The buffer list

### Dislikes
* Some of the keyboard functions for movement didn't feel too natural to me, such as "C-n" and "C-p"  I kept thinking "down" and "up" and would hit "C-d" and "C-u"
* The editor is pretty expansive, so it is not a quick skill to pick up.  I realize the benefit in everything Emacs can provide, but it will take some time to learn it all.


## *Vi*

### Likes
* The changing of text commands were easy to follow
* The cursor changes were easy to adapt to
* The overall editor, as it is simple but still provides a lot of options for editing

### Dislikes
* Switching between "Command" and "Insert" - I kept accidentally switching out of them when I did not want to
* Search and replace command - I thought it looked a bit messy and it was easy to get lost within all the characters


## *Nano*

### Likes
* Very easy to learn
* Hard to mess things up
* Help menu easily accessible


### Dislikes
* Too simple
* Range is limited with the few amount of commands
* The keyboard functions for movement
